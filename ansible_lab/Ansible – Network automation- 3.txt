Ansible â€“ Network automation- 3

In third part of ansible we progress more and add Inventory list to our command and remove more details from command and transfer them to file.

creating inventory file :

[cisco_routers]
R1 ansible_host=192.168.52.71 ansible_network_os=ios ansible_user=admin ansible_connection=network_cli
S1 ansible_host=192.168.52.72 ansible_network_os=ios ansible_user=admin ansible_connection=network_cli

change playbook-1.yml file according to this change as playbool-2.yml :

---
 
- name: playbook-2
  hosts: cisco_routers
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
 
    - name: Get config 
      ios_facts:
        gather_subset: all
 
    - name: Display the message
      debug:
        msg: "The  {{ ansible_net_hostname }} has  {{ ansible_net_iostype }}  platform"

Now new command will be :

ansible-playbook -i inventory  -k playbook-2.yml

Also you have option to send your SSH password in encrypted way instead of insert every time in unsecure condition. 
For this purpose you need to configure your ansible vault.
